# Conditions

There are three or more _factions_ of players. 

Group players into factions of size 2 to 5. 

The dungeon master (DM) provides: 
- `1 * num_factions` isolated rooms
- `3 * num_factions` candles, arranged in a row in each room with a sheet of paper denoting the "front" of the arrangement (to preserve left-right-ness).
- Exactly one lighter or book of matches
- `num_factions * (faction_size - 1)` black cards and `num_factions` red cards.
- Ideally a whiteboard in each room, but not required 

Each player provides 
- A computing device with wifi or data
- A Manifold account with nonzero mana

There should be at least one computer scientist in each group.
